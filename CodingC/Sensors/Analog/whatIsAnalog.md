Analog shows a range in integers to show what the sensor connected to that port is picking up, for example, a distance/ET sensor will output a range of numbers as it grows closer or further from an object
This is compatible with sensors like the tophat or gyro.
These variables can be used for things like line following and precise movement on the board
