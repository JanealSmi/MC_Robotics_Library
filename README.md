# MCRoboticsLibrary
  This is the official Malden Catholic Robotics Library!
  Here you can find anything from base code instructions, like how to code in C (or other languages in the future) for a beginner, and more complex methods or fuctions of code like using functions, the camera, slow servo or even precise motor ticks.
  
  Here anyone can access any piece of code and reference it for help later on, so please be respectful and follow some rules when uploading or adding code:
* Do not delete or change other's code without explicit instruction or permission, this is a resource to store information not erase it!
* Be appropriate and respectful, comments will be available for questions on specific lines as this is an open library.
* Check if what is about to be uploaded, such as base code or a how-to, is already in existance, if something must be updated alert the team and work to change the original instead of uploading more files.
* Always include comments on your code via //"comment here" (for lines of code) or /* "comment here" */ (for multiple lines), this allows people to understand what is happening!

 Feel free to copy and paste lines of code or functions onto your robots and ask questions! It is understandable that not everything will be clear when first learning how to do something!
